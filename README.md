# pomodoro-app


Is a famous technique that helps people time-manage and to get more stuff done ,this is a basically a very simple breakdown .

essentially, you figure out the task that you need to do , and then you want to set your timer to the 25 minute and then work on the task for 25 minutes . And then after that you take a short five-minute break.and after you've done four of these pomodoros , basically four repetition then you get to take a 15 to 30 minute break.

this program is building using tkinter. It's going to be a timer with a tomato on it, and when you click start, it's going to tell you to work 25 minutes when the timer's up, it will pop to tell you to take a break.So the first break is for 5 minutes and you'll notice here, we've already achieved one check mark for our first Pomodoro completed.
and once you're done with the break, then it's going to go back to work and it's going to continue until you reach the longer break or until you click reset to stop and reset the timer .
